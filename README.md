# EEG-processing-pipeline
Using EEGLAB and ERPLAB within MatLab to process EEG data.

These documents were created using information from the EEGLAB and ERPLAB wikis created by Arnaud Delorme and Steve Luck, respectively. 
The task used to elicit the ERPS analyzed in this pipeline was provided by Robert West. It is a prospective memory task that elicts the N300 and propsective positivity. 

In the final analyzes, I calculated the average amplitudes of the waveform across the appropriate time frames: 200-400 ms for the N300, 500-1000 ms for the prospective positivity. 
These extracted values were then run in the correlation adn regression models found in the Thesis and PMA repositories.
